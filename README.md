## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me learn more about background-images and background-position. Additionally, I feel like this challenge helped me improve my use of box-shadows.

```css
body {
  font-family: "Main";
  background-color: var(--Dark-cyan);
  background-image: url("./assets/images/bg-pattern-top.svg"),
    url("./assets/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
  background-position: right 51.5vw bottom 35vh, left 49vw top 52vh;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about Semantic HTML and Accessibility.

### Useful resources
